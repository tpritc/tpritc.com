# The Portfolio of Thomas Pritchard ðŸŽ¨

This is my portfolio, it's a simple, non-generated static site that uses Bootstrap at its base, but is completely customised.

## Structure

The homepage of the portfolio is in the root directory with the name `index.html`. All portfolio pieces will be in their own directory, using the naming scheme `name-like-this`, and titled `index.html` in their directory. This means that you can go to `tpritc.com/name-like-this` and it won't put a silly `/whatever.html` on the end. Looks classier ðŸ’….

Images are all in the `images` folder in the root, and if it's an image specific to a portfolio item, it's stored in `images/portfolio-item-name`.

Certain documents can be stored in the root, such as my RÃ©sumÃ©.

## GitHub Pages

Stored on Github pages. Info for hosting is:

`A Record` with IP: `192.30.252.153`
`A Record` with IP: `192.30.252.154`
`CNAME` (`www`) with URL: `tpritc.github.io`

The `CNAME` file in root should have `tpritc.com` in it.

## Copyright and shit

I made this public so that others may learn from it, but please don't rip off my stuff, it's really not cool. I'd be happy to answer any questions you'd like; just open an issue on this repo!
